            <h2>SHIRISHA</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my world of photography!  My name is D.SHIRISHA, from Khammam,Iam pursuing B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Machince Learning in Malla Reddy College Of Engineering and Technology.I am a dedicated and self-motivated person with a keen interest in software development and web design.My Hobbies are Listening Music,Drawing and photography.I am curious and am constantly learning. Mobile photography is a hobby for me; it's a passion that ignites my curiosity and fuels my creativity.
The process of capturing moments with my smartphone camera is endlessly fascinating, as it allows me to explore the world through a lens of my own making. Whether I'm experimenting with different lighting conditions, seeking out unique perspectives, or discovering hidden beauty in the mundane, each click of the shutter brings a sense of excitement and fulfillment.
Mobile photography has become an integral part of my daily life, driving me to constantly seek out new subjects, techniques, and challenges. It's not just about taking pictures; it's about immersing myself in the art of storytelling and self-expression, one frame at a time.
The memories of capturing moments with friends through photography hold a special place in my heart. Each click of the shutter is not just about preserving an image; it's about freezing a moment of laughter, camaraderie, and shared experiences.
Whether we're posing for group selfies, candidly capturing inside jokes, or adventurously exploring new places together, photography becomes a way to bond and create lastingÂ memories..</p>
